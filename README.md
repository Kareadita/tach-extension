# Komikku / Mihon / Tachiyomi Extensions

This repository contains extension catalogues which are compatible with [Komikku](https://github.com/komikku-app/komikku) and Mihon / Tachiyomi or other forks.

This repository automatically merges any updates from [Keiyoushi](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions-source) every 6 hours to have the best of community contributions. Beside from that, it has a few of my developed extensions or some improvements. Enjoy!

Some extensions from this repo provide better support for Komikku's `Suggestions` feature.

To request a new source or bug fix, [create an issue](https://github.com/yuzono/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

difficult to maintain.
